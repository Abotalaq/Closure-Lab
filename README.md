# Closure-Lab

Higher-Order Functions Lab


Objective:

To understand and use higher-order functions in Swift.


## Instructions:
1. Review the concepts of higher-order functions and closures in Swift.
2. Complete the following exercises to reinforce your understanding of higher-order functions.


### Exercise 1:
- Create a simple function that takes a closure as its argument and returns a String.
- Inside the closure, concatenate two strings and return the result.
- Call the function with the closure and print the result.


### Exercise 2:
- Create an array of integers
- Create a function that takes the array and a closure as its arguments.
- The closure should take an int and return a bool.
- The function should return an array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition specified by the closure.
- Use the filter() function to filter the array using the function and closure created above.
- Print the filtered array.


### Exercise 3:
- Create an array of integers
- Create a function that takes the array and a closure as its arguments.
- The closure should take an int and return another int.
- The function should return an array containing the results of applying the closure to each element of the original array.
- Use the map() function to map the array using the function and closure created above.
- Print the mapped array.


### Exercise 4:
- Create an array of integers
- Create a function that takes the array and a closure as its arguments.
- The closure should take an int and return void
- The function should iterate over the array and call the closure for each element
- Use the forEach() function to iterate over the array using the function and closure created above.


### Exercise 5:
- Create an array of integers
- Create a function that takes the array and a closure as its arguments.
- The closure should take an int and return a bool
- The function should return the first element of the array that satisfies the condition specified by the closure.
- Use the first(where:) function to find the first element of the array that satisfies the condition specified by the closure.
- Print the element


When you finish
- Summarize what you learned
- Compare and contrast the different Higher-order functions you used, when would you prefer one over the other?
